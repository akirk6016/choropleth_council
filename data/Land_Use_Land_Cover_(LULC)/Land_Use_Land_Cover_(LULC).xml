            <abstract>[Metadata]  Description:  Land Use Land Cover of main Hawaiian Islands as of 1976Source:	1:100,000 1976 Digital GIRAS (Geographic Information Retrieval and Analysis) files.  Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) data consists of historical land use and land cover classification data that was based primarily on the manual interpretation of 1970's and 1980's aerial photography. Secondary sources included land use maps and surveys. There are 21 possible categories of cover type.  The spatial resolution for all LULC files will depend on the format and feature type. Files in GIRAS format will have a minimum polygon area of 10 acres (4 hectares) with a minimum width of 660 feet (200 meters) for manmade features. Non-urban or natural features have a minimum polygon area of 40 acres (16 hectares) with a minimum width of 1320 feet (400 meters). Files in CTG format will have a resolution of 30 meters. For additional information, please refer to https://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/op/gis/data/lulc.pdf or contact Hawaii Statewide GIS Program, Office of Planning and Sustainable Development, State of Hawaii; PO Box 2359, Honolulu, HI 96804; (808) 587-2846; email: gis@hawaii.gov; Website: https://planning.hawaii.gov/gis.</abstract>
