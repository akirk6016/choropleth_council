             on the order of goal implementation. We will also use spatial data of priority areas
             identfied by residents to compare how the modelled scenarios compare to how people
             perceive priority needs. Additionally, we will use interview data to conduct a sentiment
             analysis on how residents qualified priorty areas. Further analyses will compare relative
             costs of solutions to build a trade-off curve'),
